1,"Dear Modiji. I am your strong follower since 2002. I highly appreciate the efforts and challenging initiatives you take to develop India. The lobby working against your goverment is trying hard to defame you. We know it will take a few years to streamline and stabilise things as it was in a worst stage when you took charge as PM. Some immediate measure that will reduce the cost of living of poor, low and medium income group is expected from the government.  After implementing GST the prices of goods and services should have fallen but it increased. The companies supplying goods have added the new tax rate with the MRP of goods which was already inclusive of tax. They should have deducted the old tax from MRP and then add the new GST rate. That's how the prices of many goods rised instead of falling. For example a particular brand of rice which costed Rs.75 is now Rs.86 per kg. Is there any RTI to know how they increased the price with so much difference. Same case is with many necessary commodities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quite a few people in my friend list have complained against it and I find 28% GST on cement kind of high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
